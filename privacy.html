        <li>To respond to your inquiries or comments, if you provide contact information and indicate you desire a response.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Providing this information is <em>entirely optional</em>. If you choose not to use the feedback form, the core functionality of the App will not be affected.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>If required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.</li>
        <li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

    <p>We take <em>reasonable measures</em> to help protect the information you submit via the feedback form from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
